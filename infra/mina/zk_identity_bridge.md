# Mina ZK Identity Bridge

## Overview

**Mina Protocol** provides **zero-knowledge proofs** for privacy-preserving identity verification.

## What is Mina ZK?

- ✅ **Zero-knowledge proofs** — Prove without revealing
- ✅ **Succinct proofs** — Small, fast verification
- ✅ **Recursive proofs** — Compose proofs together
- ✅ **Private verification** — Verify claims privately

## Why ZK for ZULU?

| Use Case | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Identity verification** | Prove identity without revealing details |
| **Access control** | Prove permissions without exposing data |
| **Credential proofs** | Prove attributes without revealing values |
| **Private attestations** | Attest to facts without full disclosure |

## Integration Plan

### Phase 1 — Basic ZK
- [ ] Connect to Mina network
- [ ] Generate ZK proofs
- [ ] Verify proofs
- [ ] Store proofs locally

### Phase 2 — Identity Features
- [ ] ZK identity proofs
- [ ] Access control via ZK
- [ ] Credential verification
- [ ] Selective disclosure proofs

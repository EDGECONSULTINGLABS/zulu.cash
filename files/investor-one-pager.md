**Private AI Agent for Zcash Shielded Payments & Merchant Settlement**

---

## 1. Summary

**ZULU** is a private, local-first AI agent that lets users pay with **shielded ZEC** while merchants receive **USDC**, using cross-chain settlement and a fully encrypted on-device ledger.

Think:  
> **"Private Venmo + private AI accountant" for Zcash users and merchants.**

Built initially during the **Zypherpunk Zcash Hackathon**, ZULU is designed to become a merchant-grade privacy payments stack.

---

## 2. Problem

AI is rapidly becoming the **interface for money**, but:

- Cloud AI models see full transaction history  
- Finance data becomes training data  
- Merchants and users lose privacy, bargaining power, and safety  

There is currently **no private AI layer** for:

- Shielded payments  
- Merchant settlement  
- Cross-chain stablecoin flows  

---

## 3. Solution

**ZULU = Local AI + Shielded ZEC + Cross-Chain Settlement**

- Local-first AI agent (Phi-3 Mini via Ollama)  
- Encrypted on-device ledger (SQLCipher)  
- Watch-only Zcash detection (no spend keys)  
- ZEC → USDC swap engine via NEAR smart contracts  
- Optional merchant onboarding via third-party regulated partner (TBA)  

**Users:**  
- Pay in shielded ZEC  
- Ask AI questions about their history  
- Never expose raw data to the cloud  

**Merchants:**  
- Accept ZEC  
- Settle in USDC  
- Avoid volatility + chargebacks  
- Get instant settlement

---

## 4. How It Works (Simple Flow)

1. Customer scans a merchant QR invoice (in USD)  
2. ZULU displays equivalent ZEC amount  
3. Customer pays using their own Zcash wallet (shielded)  
4. ZULU detects incoming shielded TX via viewing key  
5. ZEC is forwarded to NEAR-based swap engine  
6. Smart contract converts ZEC → USDC  
7. Merchant receives USDC into settlement account

ZULU never holds:
- Private keys  
- Fiat  
- Custodial balances

# OpenClaw NightShift Worker
# This is a Node.js service — dependencies are in package.json
# This file documents the Python-side expectations for the task contract
#
# The nightshift-openclaw container uses:

#   - pnpm for package management
#   - OpenClaw core runtime (stripped)
#   - Custom nightshift adapter (server.mjs)
#
# No Python dependencies required.

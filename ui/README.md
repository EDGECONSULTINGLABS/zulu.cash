# ui

Frontends for ZULU. Local-first, privacy-preserving, no telemetry.

- `components/` – shared React/Tailwind components
- `layouts/` – page shells and layout primitives
- `public/` – static assets
- `pages/` – Next.js / web entrypoints

Existing subfolders like `nextjs/`, `electron/`, and `tailwind/` are implementation-specific and can be wired into this structure over time.
